## Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for Turkey

This project explores the **Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)** hypothesis in the context of **Turkey**, using real-world **economic (GDP per capita)** and **environmental (CO₂ emissions)** data from 1970 to 2017. The EKC suggests that environmental degradation first increases with economic growth, then decreases after reaching a certain income level (turning point).

## Project Summary

- **Goal**: Test the EKC hypothesis using time-series data and econometric modeling.
- **Turning Point Identified**: Around **$10,379 GDP per capita** in the year **2014** — after which CO₂ emissions started to decline.
- **Method**: Applied polynomial regression and ADF unit root tests.

## Environmental Kuznet Curve

**The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)** hypothesizes an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental degradation and economic development. Initially proposed in the early 1990s, it builds on **Simon Kuznets'** original concept linking income inequality to economic growth. According to the EKC, as a country's income per capita rises, environmental degradation first increases due to industrialization, but eventually declines as economies mature, prioritize cleaner technologies, and enforce environmental regulations. While widely cited in environmental economics, the EKC remains debated, with empirical support varying across pollutants, countries, and development stages.
